# Movie Trailer Navigation

This contains my source code on the first project - a movie trailer navigation page. This is a pretty straightforward project, where a Movie class is created for movie poster display and trailer navigation in an HTML page.

## Usage
` Clone this repo to your local machine
` Run 'python entertainment_center.py', and the navigation page will open up in a new tab in your browser
` Enjoy!
