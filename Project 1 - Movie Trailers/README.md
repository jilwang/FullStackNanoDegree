# Movie Trailer Navigation

This contains my source code on the first project - a movie trailer navigation page. This is a pretty straightforward project, where a Movie class is created for movie poster display and trailer navigation in an HTML page.

## Usage
1. Clone this repo to your local machine
2. Run 'python entertainment_center.py' in your terminal (or any IDE you are used to), and the navigation page will open up in a new tab in your browser
3. Enjoy!
